**Django-Appointment** simplifies appointment scheduling for a variety of projects. Built with Django, it offers
customizable settings for time slots and notifications, making it a practical tool for developers looking for
a flexible solution.

## The Why

The idea of django-appointment came from a real need: a more efficient way to handle appointment scheduling for a
[photography project](https://tchiiz.com/), beyond just email requests. Finding existing solutions either too niche
(doctor/patient appointment, appointment module for clinic etc...) or not flexible enough, this project was created to
fill that gap, aiming to be a generic, simple, and adaptable option for anyone needing to integrate appointment
scheduling into their Django project.
